## Dataset

All the music pieces we used for generating the audio samples on Youtube and the evaluation in the paper can be downloaded here: https://goo.gl/sNpgQ7

## Preparation

- Install common libraries like
```
    numpy
    matplotlib
    pickle
    numpy
    progressbar
    sklearn
    scipy
    csv
    keras
    tensorflow
    theano  (some functions are only supported with theano because of recurrentshop)
```
- Make sure you have installed the following packages
    + https://github.com/craffel/pretty-midi 
    + https://github.com/farizrahman4u/recurrentshop/tree/master/recurrentshop
    + https://github.com/nschloe/matplotlib2tikz

- Put your midi data in the folder `data/original/`
- Group them into folders and name than for example `style1`, `style2`
- Make sure you have at least 10 midi files per style, otherwise it can't form a test set
- Insert your style names into classes variable in `settings.py`
- Adjust parameters for training in `settings.py`
- Make sure you have all these files in the same folder

## Training

- Run either `vae_training.py` to use the full MIDI-VAE model or
- Run any of the style classifiers `pitch_classifier.py`, `velocity_classifer.py` or `instrument_classifer.py`

The models will be stored in the automatically generated folder `models/`

## Evaluation

- Change the model_name and epoch of your MIDI-VAE model that you want to evaluate
- Change the model names and epochs and weights for all the style classifiers
- Make sure you have set the same parameters as were used during training
- Run `vae_evaluation.py`
